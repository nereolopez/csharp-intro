# C#
This is a guided introduction to C#. From time to time I become a teacher during the evenigs for professionals who are currently active and want to learn something new.
This material will be uploaded and made public as long as the course goes on. Though the course itself is not a C# Introduction, it is part of it as it is needed for the second part.

Here in [Github](https://github.com/nereolopez/csharp-intro) you can find the code, but the documenation related to it you can find it [in my blog](https://nereolopezblog.wordpress.com) where I wrote [a series on this](https://nereolopezblog.wordpress.com/2018/01/30/c-introduction-series/).
